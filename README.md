# recipe-compiler
A software to pull recipes based on ingredient selections!

This is my first project! The website uses an API to curate a list of 5 recipes based on a chosen ingredient or a random query. You can type your ingredient(s) into the ssearch bar or if you are stuck for ideas hit the random recipe generator button! Once the carousel is created with the 5 recipes you can click the title to visit the recipe's webpage or email yourself a copy of the ingredients as a grocery list!
